# --output Name of the resulting self extracting archive. Sparch automatically attaches the '.pl' extension
# --script Name of a script to run after decompressing and extracting the archive
# --files everything after this is taken to be files that are to be in the archive
# --dir Use this in place of --files if the files are in a directory. 
# if --files and --dir are specified, all specified files as well as those in the directories are archived
# If neither --dir nor --files is specified, the list of files is read in from <STDIN>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Sparch;

unedited.

Blah blah blah.

related modules or operating system documentation (such as man pages
in UNIX), or any relevant external documentation such as RFCs or
standards.
