# Sparch
Sparch is a tool for creating [self extracting archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-extracting_archive).
When an archive is created, the result is an executable Perl script with the archive attached to it. Running the script decompresses and extracts the archive. Sparch also supports running a script on extraction.
